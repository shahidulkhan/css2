<b>About Tamim</b>

<p class="first">Tamim Iqbal was already one of Bangladesh's most assured batsmen at the time of his 21st birthday, and will be a vital component at the top of the order for years to come. His promise was apparent when, batting for the Under-19s against England at the end of 2005, he smashed 112 from just 71 balls to help Bangladesh cruise to victory. The left-hander is regarded as one of the most exciting prospects in Bangladesh cricket and is arguably the hardest hitter of the cricket ball in the country. His elegance and style through the off side is a treat to watch but his trademark shot is the straight drive, capped with a text-book like follow-through. </p>
<p>Tamim is the younger brother of Bangladesh international Nafis Iqbal Khan and nephew of former Bangladesh skipper Akram Khan. He made his one-day debut against Zimbabwe in February 2007 and was included in the World Cup squad after playing just two matches. His straight six off Zaheer Khan after skipping down the track was one of the best shots of the tournament. He scored a stylish 84 in his debut Test, against New Zealand in Dunedin and has since firmly established his spot at the top of the order. His maiden century came in 2009 against West Indies in St Vincent, a match-winning effort. He then set a national record against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo when he blasted an unbeaten 154 in a tall chase.</p>
<p>Tamim has found England's bowling attack particularly to his liking, and a superb run of form against them in two series, home and away, lead to five scores of more than fifty in six Test innings, culminating in his stunning 103 at Lord's in May 2010. </p>
